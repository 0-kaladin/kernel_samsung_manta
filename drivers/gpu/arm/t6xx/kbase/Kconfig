menuconfig MALI_T6XX
	tristate "Mali-T6XX support"
	default n
	help
	  Enable this option to build support for the ARM Mali-T6XX GPU.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  this will generate a single module, called mali_kbase.

config MALI_LICENSE_IS_GPL
	bool "GPL licensed build"
	depends on MALI_T6XX
	default y
	help
	  Enable this option to build a driver which requires the GPL license.
	  Disabling this option will stop GPL APIs from being used and allow
	  the driver to be built and distributed with a commerical non-GPL license (but with limited
	  functionality).

config MALI_T6XX_DVFS
	bool "Enable DVFS"
	depends on MALI_T6XX
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to enable DVFS on MALI T6XX DDK.

config MALI_T6XX_DEMAND_POLICY
	bool "Enable demand power policy by default"
	depends on MALI_T6XX
	default n
	help
	  Sets the default power policy to "demand"

config MALI_T6XX_ENABLE_DS5

	default n
	help
	  When you start to work with the Mali-T600 Series device driver the platform-specific code of
	  the Linux kernel for your platform may not be complete. In this situation the kernel device driver
	  supports creating the platform device outside of the Linux platform-specific code.
	  Enable this option if would like to use a platform device configuration from within the device driver.

	  This can be used to test the driver in a simulated environment
	  whereby the hardware is not physically present. If the hardware is physically
	  present it will not be used. This can be used to test the majority of the
	  driver without needing actual hardware or for software benchmarking.
	  All calls to the simulated hardware will complete immediatly as if the hardware
	  completed the task.
